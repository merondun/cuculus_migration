# Evolutionary Genomics of Migration: Oriental and common cuckoos 

This project aims to investigate the evolutionary genomics underlying migratory strategy in common and oriental cuckoos. 

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **pre_processing**: Preparing fastq reads, alignment. 

- **snp_calling**: Calling SNPs from alignments, identify relatives. 

- **msmc**: Run MSMC crosscoalescent and MSMC-IM, using raw gVCFs with basic filtering for invariant sites.
